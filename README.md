A production-ready library of auditable, reusable Soroban smart contract templates for the Stellar ecosystem. Built with `soroban-sdk v21`, `#![no_std]`, and full test coverage.

## Contracts

| Contract | Path | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Escrow | `contracts/escrow` | ✅ Ready | Milestone-based trustless escrow with arbiter dispute resolution |
| Vesting | `contracts/vesting` | ✅ Ready | Linear and cliff token vesting schedules with revocation |
| Multisig | `contracts/multisig` | ✅ Ready | M-of-N multisig wallet with auto-execution and expiry |
| DAO Voting | `contracts/dao_voting` | ✅ Ready | On-chain governance with quorum and approval basis points |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add WASM target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Clone & Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/soroban-contract-library.git
cd soroban-contract-library

# Build all contracts (native)
cargo build --workspace

# Build WASM artifacts
cargo build --workspace --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace
```

---

## Deploy to Testnet

The repository includes a helper script that builds every contract as release
WASM and deploys the artifacts to Stellar testnet.

```bash
# Create or choose a funded testnet identity first
stellar keys generate alice --network testnet --fund

# Deploy all contracts and print their contract IDs
./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh alice
```

You can also provide the source account through the environment:

```bash
STELLAR_SOURCE_ACCOUNT=alice ./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh
```

The script fails fast when the Stellar CLI is missing, when the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` Rust target is not installed, or when a source account
is not provided. See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for prerequisites
and options.

## Contract Summaries

### Escrow
Trustless milestone-based escrow. A depositor locks funds split across milestones. An arbiter or depositor can release individual milestones to the beneficiary. Either party can raise a dispute, which the arbiter resolves. Depositor can reclaim unreleased funds after expiry.

**Key functions:** `create`, `release_milestone`, `raise_dispute`, `resolve_dispute`, `reclaim_expired`, `get_escrow`

### Vesting
Token vesting with `Linear` (pro-rata over time) and `Cliff` (all-or-nothing at cliff ledger) modes. Supports revocable schedules where the funder can claw back unvested tokens.

**Key functions:** `create_schedule`, `vested_amount`, `claim`, `revoke`, `get_schedule`

### Multisig
M-of-N multisig wallet. Owners propose token transfers; the proposer auto-approves. Once the approval threshold is reached the transfer executes automatically. Proposals expire at a configurable ledger.

**Key functions:** `initialize`, `propose_transfer`, `approve`, `cancel`, `get_proposal`, `get_config`

### DAO Voting
On-chain governance with configurable quorum (basis points of total supply) and approval ratio (basis points of votes cast). Voters supply their own `voting_power` — making this a clean integration point for token-weighted voting. Passed proposals can execute an optional on-chain token transfer.

**Key functions:** `initialize`, `submit_proposal`, `vote`, `finalize`, `execute`, `cancel`, `get_proposal`, `get_config`
